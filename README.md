This effort was critical in identifying technical issues during system and software integration as appliances were deployed into customer environments. In addition, worked with members of all component development teams and infrastructure personnel to adjust software design and implementation mechanics, ultimately leading to better continuous deployment.

Designed and implemented several prototypes of a large-scale node graph visualization (100K+ nodes), giving full network situational awareness as a next-generation capability.

Designed and implemented the first prototype and implementation of the product’s user interface and RESTful API. Used a combination of AngularJS, Node.js, MongoDB and WebSockets to produce a fully streaming architecture to receive information and alerts from the product processing pipeline.
